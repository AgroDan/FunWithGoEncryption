# Fun with Go Encryption

I don't have a goal here, I just wanted to learn how to encrypt things using Go. I wrote a new method of encryption using a Feistal Network that works pretty well, also figured out how to encrypt files using a stream cipher and well-known encryption methods. I rolled my own crypto, then used the industry-standard methods.

Uploading this to github for my own edification and if anyone else would like to see as well.

## CAUTION

This goes without saying, but I wrote my own encryption here using a well-known Feistal Network foundation, but this is BY NO MEANS production-ready. Do not use my home-made encryption methods to secure anything important. If you do, I am not responsible for when some big-brained crypto-master figures out how to decrypt it, which I'm sure won't take that long to do with the right know-how.
